## introduction

- Single cta backtesting framework for Low tide captial, mainly using simple moving average to generate signals.

- Optimizing the parameters of the moving average to maximize the return of the strategy.

- Aiming to create a new trading strategy that can be added to classic 60/40 paramter

- Add some metrics to evaluate the performance of the strategy

## TODOS

- optimize the paramters of portfolio allocation. Maybe dynimiclly change the allocation based on the market condition; try with fixed allocation

## develop Calender

- 2024-10-24: start the project
- 2024-10-26: finish the basic structure of the project; can generate trend following strategy's PnL; can see the graph using excel
- 2024-10-28: thanks to Marshal, we get the raw data from bloomberg including bonds, SPY and XAU. We will build a classic
40/60 portfolio based on bonds and SPY. And add some metrics. Using quantstats to draw graphs.
- 2024-10-30ï¼šfinish basic 60/40 portfolio and its PnL; build metrics to evaluate; use 6040 Portfolio as benchmark; Plot graphs for visiualization
- 2024-11-03: change Simple Moving Average to Exponential Moving Average; add more metrics to evaluate the strategy; add more graphs for visualization; grid search and 3D heatmap to find the best parameters
